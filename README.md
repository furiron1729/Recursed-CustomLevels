Recursed: The Ice Palace is a free community DLC for the puzzle game Recursed.
I was not involved in the production of this custom level, but I will upload here a separate modified version of some of levels.

How to update
0. Install the original The Ice Palace or Japanese-language MOD.
    This process is necessary to rewrite the data/nexus.lua file and make the link to The Ice Palace appear.

1. Go to the Recursed data folder.
    example. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Recursed

2. Overwrite or add the enclosed TheIcePalace folder to the Recursed/TheIcePalace folder.

3. Overwrite or add the enclosed data/TheIcePalace.lua file to the Recursed/data/TheIcePalace.lua file.
    Note. Japanese-language mods are not supported.

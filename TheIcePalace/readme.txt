This version is v1.0.1.


What is it?
-----------
It's a DLC world, just like The Oobleck Conundrum or The Last Tapestry. But
instead of introducing a new item, it features a collection of good custom
levels that community members made.


Is it difficult?
----------------
Yes. *nod nod* So we locked up The Ice Palace until you see the ending. Even
though you already saw the ending, we recommend you to get most of the gems
first, including The Oobleck Conundrum and The Last Tapestry.

First few levels would be easy, but increasingly difficult levels will appear
as you progress. Oh, by the way, the difficulty is evaluated only by the
crystal puzzle.


How can I install it?
---------------------
:: Using Installation Script (Windows) ::

1. Unzip the installation file.
2. Execute “setup-Windows.bat”.
3. A file dialog will pop up. Select your Steam directory.
   (e.g. “C:​\Program Files (x86)​\Steam”)
4. Wait, and done!
5. You’ll find the new world at the top right corner of the screen when you
   enter the nexus. The Ice Palace will be unlocked after you see the ending.

:: Installing Manually (all platforms) ::

1. Download and unzip the DLC file.
2. Open the Recursed game directory in the file browser. You can locate it by
   following the steps below.

  a. Open the Steam client.
  b. Right-click Recursed in your library. Select “Properties.”
  c. Click on the “Local Files” tab.
  d. Click on the “Browse Local Files...” button.
  e. (Mac only) Right-click the “Recursed.app” and select “Show Package Contents.”
     Navigate into the “Contents/Resources” directory.
  f. If you can see the folders named “data” and “shaders”, you got there.

3. Copy “TheIcePalace” folder from the unzipped DLC folder into the Recursed
   game directory.
4. For easy un/re-installation, backup the original “nexus.lua” and other
   “nexus-*.lua” files in the Recursed “data” directory to somewhere safe.
5. Copy all the files in the “data” directory from the DLC folder into the Recursed
   “data” directory. Overwrite the “nexus.lua” and other “nexus-*.lua” files.
6. Done!
7. You’ll find the new world at the top right corner of the screen when you
   enter the nexus. The Ice Palace will be unlocked after you see the ending.

FAQ
---
Q. What is this locked big chest in the middle of The Ice Palace?

A. Welcome to A Day Out!

   This special world contains six very hard levels. These levels were simple
   yet extremely hard to be in The Ice Palace, so we gathered them to make a
   new world. Dare solve it?


Q. In the first level “Easy Mode”, boxes keep block the narrow hole next to the
   start position. It’s very annoying.

A. Down + Jump = Fall off from a box.

   You don’t have to know this, but it will make your life much easier.


Q. This level is too hard, I need a hint.

A. Alright, we can give you hints.

   Sometimes, to halt the game and start logical deduction helps. But if you
   still think it’s too hard, feel free to contact us or start a thread in the
   Steam discussion. Also, please feel free to share your hints and solutions!
   We don’t mind it as long as you take care of the spoilers.

Q. This level is logically impossible and I can prove it!

A. You missed something.

   Believe me, all gems are collectible. Have you got the diamond in The Void —
   Escalate? How about the ruby in The Last Tapestry — Flight? Didn't you think
   these levels were also impossible? Same goes here.

   Or maybe it’s the case which you missed some unusual control tricks, just
   like some key moves in some levels. Do you remember yourself solving The Void
   — Clutch?

   We have found some other original tricks. Some levels are completely built
   on it, which may seem to be logically impossible to solve until you get the
   trick. You could solve it when you catch the trick.


Q. I hate jars.

A. Good.

   Working as intended.


Q. Bug! Strange behavior!

A. It doesn’t change anything.

   - Oobleck in aqua mortua: Wow, you are pretty quick-witted. You reached Low
     Tide, right? It’s actually a hidden feature that Portponky made. It doesn’t
     change anything though, we didn’t want to actively use it.

   - Submerged ledge: Portponky was too lazy to make properly working submerged
     ledge, so they are actually translucent solid blocks. Fear not! We designed
     levels very carefully to make sure it doesn’t change anything.

   There were several other non-intuitive behaviors (such as making the second
   paradox by entering a cauldron, instead of leaving a room) which are really
   hard to understand, but no puzzle exploits them, so relax.


Q. Is there any hint for the locations of diamonds/rubies, or at least the
   number of them?

A. Yep.

   For The Ice Palace — yes, two rooms contain hints. One room shows the total
   number of each of the gems. The other room shows the exact locations of them.
   Navigate rooms carefully.

   For A Day Out — no. We believe you already realized how to distinguish whether
   a level contains bonus gems or not by now.


Q. Are you going to translate the mission names?

A. Nah.

   We can’t do all the translations job — we know you can read English, ’cuz this
   sentence is written in English.


Q. Will this DLC be updated?

A. Maybe, maybe not.

   It might be updated if more great custom levels are made or we desperately
   have to remove some unexpected alternative solutions. We will inform you
   about the update by email if you subscribe us. Currently we have a future
   plan about releasing the “Honorable Mentions” level pack, which contains some
   interesting levels we decided not to include in The Ice Palace.


Q. How can I remove this DLC?

A. How sad! You don’t.

   Just kidding. If you installed the DLC manually, you can try to undo it. If
   anything goes wrong, or you have installed the DLC using the installation
   script, then you can remove the contents in the Recursed game directory and
   reinstall the game on the Steam client.

   Beware that all the custom levels will get removed when you do this, so make
   sure to back up the custom folder if you have played any custom levels before.
